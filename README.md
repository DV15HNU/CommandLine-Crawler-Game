CRAWLER GAME

The user can execute this file through the command line.
If the user is in the directory of the .exe file, then it can access the executable file by typing ‘Crawler.exe.’ 
Another way to access this is by going into my visual studio code and running the project which will then run the file.  

The aim of the game is that the user needs to travel to the co ordinate with the letter 'E'.
The user input is done through the keybaord.
The user uses the WASD keys to move throughout the map without pressing enter after each letter.
The map is loaded by the 'load' command and played through the 'play' command. 
The user can go and get gold on the map.
It can then finish the games by going to the 'E' on the map.
